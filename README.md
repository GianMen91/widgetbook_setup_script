# ðŸ“– Widgetbook Setup Script  

## Overview  
This script automates the integration of [Widgetbook](https://widgetbook.io/) into your Flutter project. It scans your `lib` directory for all widgets (`StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`) and generates corresponding Widgetbook use-cases, allowing you to preview them interactively.  

## Features  
- âœ… Automates the setup of a Widgetbook project within a 'widgetbook' directory, streamlining the steps outlined in the Widgetbook [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.widgetbook.io/guides/quick-start).
- âœ… Scans your Flutter project's `lib` directory for all widgets.  
- âœ… Generates use-cases for each widget and saves them in `widgetbook/lib`, preserving the original directory structure.  
- âœ… Runs `build_runner` to generate the required `main.directories.g.dart` file.

## Usage  
1. Place the script in the root directory of your Flutter project (same level as `lib`, `pubspec.yaml`, etc.).  
2. Open a terminal in the project root.  
3. Run the script:

```sh
bash widgetbook_setup.sh
```

# Running Widgetbook
Once the script is finished and the setup is complete, navigate to the widgetbook directory and start Widgetbook:

 ```sh
 cd widgetbook  
 flutter run
 ```
